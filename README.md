# Pacman-Game-using-iGraphics

## Introduction
We are using iGraphics library of C language to implement the Pacman game. This is a very simple project built for the CSE-102 course (Stractured programming language sessional) of CSE, BUET. 

## How to run it
All necessary files are given in the ```iGraphics``` folder. There is also a manual about installing using it with CodeBlocks IDE. If you are using CLion or any other IDE that uses CMakeLists, you can read [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43200926/how-to-add-opengl-library-in-clion/56598660#56598660) on StackOverflow written by me. 

## Gameplay
It's pretty intuitive. Up button for going up, left button for going left etc. Don't get eaten, live as long as you can. Your score will be updated with time.
